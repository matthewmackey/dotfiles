! Switch Right-click ("Applicaiton") Key and Super/Windows key
!
! This will properly map the Right-click key to the Super key,
! and it will make that key function the same as the regular Super
! key on the left of the keyboard for all of my Super key
! keyboard shortcuts.
!
! ...However, it will not open the "Start" menu. Getting a Super
! key to do that is some lower-level Gnome stuff, but this is
! fine for my purposes b/c I'm mainly using it for the
! keyboard shortcuts.

! Remap Menu key (keycode 135) to Super_L (Windows key)
keycode 135 = Super_L

! Add Super_L to Mod4 so it functions as the Super key
!
! Not sure if this is actually necessary
add Mod4 = Super_L
